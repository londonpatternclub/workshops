## About

This repository contains media and documentation for workshop activities. For example, this includes:

* Presentation slides
* Links to further resources
* Files that were created and worked through during workshops.

### Adding files

Files should be organised under the following folder structure:

```bash
{title}
└── {yyyy-mm-dd}
    └── media
        ├── file a
        ├── file b
        └── ...
```
For example:

```bash
algorithmic-modelling-in-grasshopper
└── 2024-05-25
    └── media
        ├── slides.pdf
        ├── example.gh
        └── ... 
```

Any images or resources within files or folders should be free-to-use, for example under a Creative Commons license.
