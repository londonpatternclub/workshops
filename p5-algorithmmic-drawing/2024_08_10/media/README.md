## Algorithmic Drawing with p5.js
### A workshop by London Pattern Club

#### taught by James Walker and Marysia TaÅ„ska (she/her)

### Workshop plan
- **Introduction to London Pattern Club** (James)<br><br>
- **Introduction to p5.js** (Marysia)
	- what is p5 and how it relates to JavaScript: https://p5js.org/about/
	- intro to the code editor: https://editor.p5js.org/
	- documentation: https://p5js.org/reference/
	- looking for resources
    - [further learning resources](#further-learning-resources) <br><br>
  
- **Beginner coding intro** - [slides](https://github.com/londonpatternclub/workshops/blob/main/p5-algorithmmic-drawing/2024_08_10/media/2024_08_10_pattern_club_p5_intro_no_images.pdf) (Marysia):
  - Demo 1 - the interface and printing to the console<br>
  	- code - starter: https://editor.p5js.org/marysiatanska/sketches/mttZ385he
    - code - finished - will be added after the workshop<br><br>
  - Demo 2 - variables, basic drawing and conditional statements: <br> 
    - how to draw a circle
    - how to change colour
    - add mouse interaction
    - conditional ("if") statements 
    - code - starter: starter code: https://editor.p5js.org/marysiatanska/sketches/VhBPo_aDd
    - code - finished - will be added after the workshop<br><br>
  - Demo 3 - "for" loops and functions: 
    - introduce a loop
    - introduce a function
    - code - starter: duplicate the finished Demo 2
    - code - finished - will be added after the workshop<br><br>
- **Introduction to Anni Albers** (James)<br><br>
- **Coding demo: make an Anni-Albers-style graphic** (James)

### Exercise
Try to expand the code from James's demo into your own artwork. Things you could try:
- edit shapes and colours,<br><br>
- add a mouse or camera interaction,<br><br>
- add an animation,<br><br>
- make the animation interactive.<br><br>

Feel free to refer to the code from earlier demos, p5 documentation, search engines (e.g. Google, DuckDuckGo) and LLMs (such as ChatGPT) for references.

### Tips:
#### Using AI to learn coding
I would encourage you to start coding on your own, without the help of AI - it will help build a better foundation for your skills.

If you decide to use AI, for example ChatGPT, try to use prompts like "could you explain this code to me" or "could you explain how to" rather than "generate code for..."
