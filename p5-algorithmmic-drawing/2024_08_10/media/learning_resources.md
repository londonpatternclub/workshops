## p5.js and general JavaScript learning resources

### p5.js resources
#### p5.js website with technical documentation (references) and examples.
https://p5js.org/<br><br>

#### Coding Train - Daniel Shiffman's channel on YouTube.

Examples include JavaScript using the p5.js library, as well as Processing (a different programming language). If you go to the "Courses" section, there's a lot of beginner-friendly materials. The "Coding Challenge" series has a lot of interesting, but mostly a bit more advanced tutorials (you may need to translate them from Processing).
